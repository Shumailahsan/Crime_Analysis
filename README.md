# Crime_Analysis

<h1>Crime Data Analysis in India (2001–2013) | Using R & SQL</h1>  
<p>
I’m excited to share one of my recent projects where I analyzed 13 years of crime data across India, covering the period from 2001 to 2013. This project was not only a deep dive into numbers, but also a meaningful exploration of how socio-economic and regional factors may shape crime patterns over time.

Using R programming, I handled data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis, while SQL helped me structure and query the raw datasets efficiently. Together, they made it possible to track growth rates, year-on-year changes, and category-wise trends in reported crimes.

--Key highlights of the project:
 * Identified crime trends across different states and union territories
 * Calculated and visualized the growth rate of crime over 13 years
 * Highlighted the most and least reported crime categories over time
 * Created graphs and dashboards to make the data more accessible and insightful

This project gave me hands-on experience in-

 - Tools & Skills Used:

R (tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr)
SQL (for querying large datasets)
Data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling

-Takeaway:

 Crime statistics aren’t just numbers—they reflect social dynamics, policy implications, and lived realities. Through this analysis, I aimed to uncover patterns that can help in better decision-making and resource allocation.
